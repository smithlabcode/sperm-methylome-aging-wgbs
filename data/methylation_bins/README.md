 - `age_cpg_methylation_correlation_100kbp_bins_CHM13.bed` shows the
   donor-corrected correlation between methylation values and age for
   100kb bins on CHM13.

 - `cpg_methylation_100kbp_bins_CHM13.bed` shows the average
   methylation level across all 20 donors in 100kb bins  genome-wide.

 - `sample_10kb_bins.txt` gives the average methylation in 10 kbp
  bins in the human genome across all samples, excluding bins for
  which at least one of the samples does not contain any reads
  (in other words, only using samples with data in all samples).
