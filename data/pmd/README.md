# Data files

This directory contains data pertinet to section 2.3 of the manuscript
(related to partially methylated domains, used as a proxy to infer
regions that are constitutively late replicating). Files depict the
average methylation values of 100 kb bins inside and outside of
PMDs. Each file is a BED file, where fields 5 and 6 are the mean
methylation and the donor-adjusted correlation between age and the bin
methylation. So unlike a BED6 format, the final column is not strand.
These data files are strand independent.
